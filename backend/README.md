This project is a simple Node.js + Express backend that provides an API for browsing a list of Toronto Blue Jays players. The server exposes routes to get the current player, move to the next or previous one, or access a player by index. The data is stored in a single JavaScript file and returned in JSON format. The backend is designed to be used by a frontend page that displays each player with their name, description, and image.
